A powerful HID injection platform built for the **ESP32-S2/S3**, designed for hackers, red teamers, and tinkerers. Inspired by the original Hak5 USB Rubber Ducky, this project extends the functionality with modern features like **DuckyScript v3**, **BLE HID**, **web UI control**, and **GPIO-triggered payloads** ‚Äî all in an open, self-hosted platform.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is a **tool for learning, research, automation, and security testing**. Use responsibly and only on devices you own or have explicit permission to test.

## üî• Supported Features

- ‚úÖ A majority of the DuckyScript v1/v2/v3 interpreter funcionality (including `IF`, `WHILE`, `VAR`, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Web-based interface for script management and configuration
- ‚úÖ USB HID injection (keyboard + mouse)
- ‚úÖ BLE HID support (Bluetooth attacks on compatible targets)
- ‚úÖ USB Mass Storage mode (mount drive with payloads)
- ‚úÖ GPIO-triggered payload execution
- ‚úÖ LED and optional TFT screen for real-time feedback
- ‚úÖ Wi-Fi and mDNS access point with fallback captive portal

## üéØ Legitimate Use Cases

This tool can be used for a wide range of non-malicious purposes:

- Penetration testing in controlled environments
- Red teaming engagements with proper authorization
- Automating kiosk input, form entry, or developer tools
- Accessibility or usability testing of input interfaces
- Educational purposes ‚Äî learn scripting, USB, BLE, and embedded development

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Use Reminder

**This project is for educational and ethical hacking purposes only.** Unauthorized use against devices, networks, or systems without consent may be illegal and unethical. Always get permission before deploying this tool in the field.

## üöÄ Attack Modes

Switch USB functionality dynamically from DuckyScript:

```ducky
ATTACKMODE HID             # Emulates keyboard/mouse
ATTACKMODE STORAGE         # Emulates USB Mass Storage
ATTACKMODE HID STORAGE     # Combines HID and storage
```

Define a payload for the physical button:

```ducky
BUTTON_DEF payloads/my_script.txt
```

Example: `payloads/Examples/attackmode_demo.txt`

## üåê Web Interface & WiFi

If no Wi-Fi is configured, the device launches an AP:

- **SSID**: `iPh0ne12`
- **Password**: `12345678`
- **Web UI**: [http://192.168.4.1](http://192.168.4.1) or [http://n3wbswifiduck.local](http://n3wbswifiduck.local)

Use the interface to:

- Upload/edit/run DuckyScript payloads
- Configure Wi-Fi, locale, autorun, GPIO, and more

## üõ† Flashing via Web Serial

To flash your ESP32-S2/S3 device:

1. Visit [https://esptool.spacehuhn.com/](https://esptool.spacehuhn.com/)
2. Connect your board via USB and select the serial port
3. Download the `.zip` firmware from [Releases](https://github.com/x0SiN0x/n3wbWiFiDucky/releases)
4. Extract and flash the `.bin` files:

| File           | Offset     |
|----------------|------------|
| `bootloader.bin` | `0x1000`   |
| `partitions.bin` | `0x8000`   |
| `firmware.bin`   | `0x10000`  |
| `littlefs.bin`   | `0x290000` *(LilyGO only)* |

Works in modern browsers (Chrome, Edge) with no drivers required.
